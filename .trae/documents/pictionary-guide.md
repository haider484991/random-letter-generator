- Timer (1-2 minutes per round)
- Score sheet
- 2 or more players (ideally 4-8 players in teams)

**Team Formation:**
- Divide players into teams of 2-4 people
- Teams should be roughly equal in size
- Mix skill levels across teams for balanced play

### Step-by-Step Gameplay Instructions

**Round Setup:**
1. One team selects a drawer for the round
2. The drawer picks a word card or generates a word
3. Set the timer for the agreed duration (typically 60-90 seconds)
4. The drawer reviews the word without showing teammates

**Drawing Phase:**
1. Start the timer when the drawer begins
2. The drawer attempts to illustrate the word using only pictures
3. No letters, numbers, or verbal clues are allowed
4. Teammates guess aloud while the drawer continues

**Guessing Phase:**
1. Teammates call out guesses based on the drawing
2. The drawer can nod, shake head, or use gestures to indicate progress
3. If the correct word is guessed, the team scores a point
4. If time runs out without a correct guess, no points are awarded

**Turn Rotation:**
1. Play passes to the next team
2. Each team member should get a chance to draw
3. Continue until a predetermined score is reached or time limit expires

### Scoring System

**Standard Scoring:**
- 1 point for each correctly guessed word
- Bonus points for guessing within first 30 seconds (optional)
- First team to reach 10-15 points wins

**Alternative Scoring:**
